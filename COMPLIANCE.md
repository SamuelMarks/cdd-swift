# OpenAPI 3.2.0 Compliance

We aim for full compliance with the [OpenAPI Specification 3.2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.2.0.md).

## Current Status

- **OpenAPI Object**: Basic parsing and generation.
- **Info Object**: Support for title and version.
- **Paths Object**: Supports basic `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete` operations.
- **Components Object**: Generates and parses Schemas.

More features are progressively being implemented until full 3.2.0 spec compliance is achieved.
